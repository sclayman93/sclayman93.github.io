I am a recent Data Science graduate and Data Analyst. From my background in biology and political data research, I have experience collecting and analysing data and handling large datasets. This developed my interest in pursuing Data Science. In an ever more digital world, the importance of data will only increase. This makes data science an exciting role to move into and one which can provide meaningful insights to many industries such as business, finance, politics, and tech.
